# AI-assisted Volunteer Demand & Shift Decision Support

Explainable, human-in-the-loop decision support for volunteer staffing.
This project flags staffing risks (Green / Amber / Red) and highlights skill gaps
based on simple footfall and skill coverage data.

## Use case
Designed for non-profit retail environments (e.g. Red Cross op shops):
- Two daily slots: 09:00–13:00, 13:00–17:00
- Skills: Cashier, Sorting, Frontdesk, Donations processing, Shop floor

## What this is (and is not)
- ✔ Decision support only
- ✔ Explainable rules + AI summaries
- ✘ No automated rostering
- ✘ No personal data

## Contents
- Process diagram
- Excel template
- Prompt pack
- Sample data
## How to use

1. Record daily shift information in the Excel template  
   (`excel/volunteer_shift_template.xlsx`):
   - Fill in footfall level (Low / Med / High)
   - Record number of volunteers by skill for each time slot

2. Review staffing rules in the `Rules` sheet:
   - Minimum headcount per footfall level
   - Must-have skills for each scenario

3. Use the prompts in the `prompts/` folder to generate decision support:
   - Flag staffing risks (Green / Amber / Red)
   - Identify missing skills
   - Suggest minimum headcount and skill mix

4. A human coordinator reviews the AI output and makes the final decision.

This workflow is designed for decision support only and does not automate rostering.


## Responsible AI
Human-in-the-loop, data minimisation, transparent assumptions.
